/**
 ContentFilter is an abstract base class from which all content filters must be
 derived.
 
 It implements default handling for all the methods in its interface with
 the exception of the core data-modification method FilterData().
 
 Content filters are typically invoked with multiple chunks of data while an item
 is loaded from its container. Subclasses can override RequiresCompleteData() if
 they reqire access to all the data at once in order to function, but it is
 preferred if they support streaming, for performance reasons.
 
 Content filters are *chained*, similar to a singly-linked list. When a content
 filter is installed into a Package, it goes at the head of the list. Any existing
 filter is passed to the new one's SetNextFilter() method. In this way, multiple
 filters may be installed for a single content type, with processing proceeding in
 LIFO order.
 
 The implementation *always* queries every filter in the chain: if one filter
 modifies the data, that modified data will be seen by a later filter. This means
 that a later-added filter will not 'replace' one that was added earlier.
 
 @note The next filter is contained in a std::unique_ptr; this means each filter
 in the chain 'owns' the reference to the next, and is solely responsible for
 deleting it.
