To build, run:
CC=clang CXX=clang cmake ../..
make

[Built Enviornment]
Ubuntu 12.04
cmake 2.4
clang 3.4 (maybe a previous version works, but 3.0 did not work)
libc++

The 'include' directory is copied from Platform/Android.
Some source files in ePub3/ is modified for the compatibilty of clang on Linux.
Most files of ePub3/ThirdParty are not added into library, because they have equivalent Linux library.
Not tested yet. (I am working on SDKLauncher-Linux)
